# 🍽️ Flavour Sense Prediction by Life and Climate

Predicting human flavour sense preferences based on life expectancy, climate, and geography using machine learning.

## 🌍 Overview

This project explores how flavour sense — such as preference for salty, sweet, bitter, etc. — may be influenced by factors including climate, geographical features, and life expectancy across different regions. Leveraging data science and machine learning, the model aims to capture patterns in human flavour sense variation around the globe.

## 🧪 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with insightful visualizations
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model development with Random Forest Classifier
- Performance evaluation with classification metrics
- Interpretability of features contributing to flavour sense prediction

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes:

- **Life expectancy indicators**  
- **Climate variables** (temperature, humidity, etc.)  
- **Geographical variables** (region, country, etc.)  
- **Flavour sense categories** (target variable)

*(Please refer to the notebook for feature details and preprocessing steps.)*

## 🔍 Exploratory Analysis

Key insights revealed:

- Certain climatic conditions correlate with stronger preference for certain tastes
- Life expectancy may have subtle links with flavour sense
- Visualizations highlighted regional variations in taste preferences

## 🤖 Modeling

- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier  
- **Evaluation**: Classification report and confusion matrix  
- **Performance**: High accuracy, robust feature importance interpretation
